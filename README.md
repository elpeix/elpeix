I'm **elpeix** (which means *The Fish* in Catalan), a developer who enjoys building things—some useful, some just because I can. If it involves code and a bit of overengineering, count me in.

### 🚀 Projects

- **[apicalls](https://github.com/elpeix/apicalls)**: A desktop app built with Electron that makes testing REST APIs a breeze. Because manually typing `curl` commands is so last decade.

- **[kaa](https://github.com/elpeix/kaa)**: A minimalist Python server framework for REST apps. Simple, clean, and does what it says—no unnecessary magic, just good old RESTful efficiency.

- **[connect4](https://github.com/elpeix/connect4)**: The classic Connect Four game, but with my own twist. Because sometimes, between serious projects, you just need to drop some discs and feel like a strategist.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Electron, React, Node.js
- **Shell**: fish shell, of course 🐟

### 📫 Let's Connect
